# CS121_final_project
This is the repository for Caltech CS 121 final project
## Packages
We used the `prettytable` to format our output, the `mysql-connection-python` to connect the Mysql to Python, therefore you must install them before using.
```bash
pip install prettytable
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
